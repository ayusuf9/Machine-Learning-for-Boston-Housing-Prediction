# Boston Housing Value Prediction üè†üíπ
## Overview
This repository dives deep into the renowned Boston Housing dataset, undertaking a rigorous analysis and leveraging various machine learning techniques to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes. Through methodical exploration and model tuning, we aim to provide robust predictions that can offer valuable insights into Boston's real estate landscape.

# Dataset Information
The Boston Housing dataset is a classic in the realm of machine learning and statistics. It contains information about various homes in Boston, including features like crime rate, average number of rooms, accessibility to highways, and more. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes.

# Analysis & Techniques
## Several machine learning models have been explored in this project, including but not limited to:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosted Trees
A thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) precedes the modeling to understand the data distribution, relationships, and potential anomalies.
